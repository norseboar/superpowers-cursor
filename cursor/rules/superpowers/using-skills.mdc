# Using Skills

When executing a skill (via command or rule), follow these mandatory guidelines.

<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
IF A SKILL APPLIES TO YOUR TASK, YOU DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE. YOU MUST USE IT.

This is not negotiable. This is not optional. You cannot rationalize your way out of this.
</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

## Critical Rules

1. **Follow mandatory workflows.** Brainstorming before coding. Verification before completion. Use the established process.

2. **Announce skill usage.** Before using a skill, announce that you are using it: "I'm using [Skill Name] to [what you're doing]."

   **Examples:**

   - "I'm using the brainstorming skill to refine your idea into a design."
   - "I'm using the test-driven-development skill to implement this feature."

   **Why:** Transparency helps your human partner understand your process and catch errors early. It also confirms you actually read the skill.

## Tool Mapping for Cursor

When skills reference tools you don't have, substitute your equivalent tools:
- `TodoWrite` → `todo_write` (your task tracking/planning tool)
- `Task` tool with sub-agents → Tell the user that sub-agents aren't available in Cursor yet and you'll do the work the sub-agent would do
- `Read`, `Write`, `Edit`, `Bash` → Use your native tools with similar functions

## Common Rationalizations That Mean You're About To Fail

If you catch yourself thinking ANY of these thoughts, STOP. You are rationalizing. Follow the skill exactly.

- "This is just a simple question" → WRONG. Questions are tasks. Follow the skill.
- "I can check git/files quickly" → WRONG. Files don't have conversation context. Follow the skill.
- "Let me gather information first" → WRONG. Skills tell you HOW to gather information. Follow the skill.
- "This doesn't need a formal skill" → WRONG. If a skill exists for it, use it.
- "I remember this skill" → WRONG. Skills evolve. Follow the current version.
- "This doesn't count as a task" → WRONG. If you're taking action, it's a task. Follow the skill.
- "The skill is overkill for this" → WRONG. Skills exist because simple things become complex. Use it.
- "I'll just do this one thing first" → WRONG. Follow the skill BEFORE doing anything.

**Why:** Skills document proven techniques that save time and prevent mistakes. Not using available skills means repeating solved problems and making known errors.

If a skill for your task exists, you must use it or you will fail at your task.

## Skills with Checklists

If a skill has a checklist, YOU MUST create `todo_write` todos for EACH item.

**Don't:**

- Work through checklist mentally
- Skip creating todos "to save time"
- Batch multiple items into one todo
- Mark complete without doing them

**Why:** Checklists without `todo_write` tracking = steps get skipped. Every time. The overhead of `todo_write` is tiny compared to the cost of missing steps.

## About these skills

**Many skills contain rigid rules (TDD, debugging, verification).** Follow them exactly. Don't adapt away the discipline.

**Some skills are flexible patterns (architecture, naming).** Adapt core principles to your context.

The skill itself tells you which type it is.

## Instructions ≠ Permission to Skip Workflows

Your human partner's specific instructions describe WHAT to do, not HOW.

"Add X", "Fix Y" = the goal, NOT permission to skip brainstorming, TDD, or RED-GREEN-REFACTOR.

**Red flags:** "Instruction was specific" • "Seems simple" • "Workflow is overkill"

**Why:** Specific instructions mean clear requirements, which is when workflows matter MOST. Skipping process on "simple" tasks is how simple tasks become complex problems.

## Summary

**When executing a skill:**

1. Announce you're using it
2. Follow what it says exactly
3. If it has a checklist → `todo_write` for every item

**Following a relevant skill = mandatory. Not optional.**
