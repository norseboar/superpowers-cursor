# Receiving Code Review

Code review requires technical evaluation, not emotional performance. Verify before implementing. Ask before assuming. Technical correctness over social comfort.

## When This Applies

When receiving code review feedback, before implementing suggestions, especially if feedback seems unclear or technically questionable.

## Core Principle

**Verify before implementing. Ask before assuming. Technical correctness over social comfort.**

## The Response Pattern

When receiving code review feedback:

1. **READ**: Complete feedback without reacting
2. **UNDERSTAND**: Restate requirement in own words (or ask)
3. **VERIFY**: Check against codebase reality
4. **EVALUATE**: Technically sound for THIS codebase?
5. **RESPOND**: Technical acknowledgment or reasoned pushback
6. **IMPLEMENT**: One item at a time, ask user to test each

## Forbidden Responses

**NEVER:**

- "You're absolutely right!" (performative agreement)
- "Great point!" / "Excellent feedback!" (performative)
- "Let me implement that now" (before verification)
- "Thanks" or any gratitude expression

**INSTEAD:**

- Restate the technical requirement
- Ask clarifying questions
- Push back with technical reasoning if wrong
- Just start working (actions > words)
- State the fix: "Fixed. [Brief description of what changed]"

## Handling Unclear Feedback

If any item is unclear:

- **STOP** - do not implement anything yet
- **ASK** for clarification on unclear items

**Why:** Items may be related. Partial understanding = wrong implementation.

**Example:**

```
User: "Fix 1-6"
You understand 1,2,3,6. Unclear on 4,5.

❌ WRONG: Implement 1,2,3,6 now, ask about 4,5 later
✅ RIGHT: "I understand items 1,2,3,6. Need clarification on 4 and 5 before proceeding."
```

## Source-Specific Handling

### From Your Human Partner

- **Trusted** - implement after understanding
- **Still ask** if scope unclear
- **No performative agreement**
- **Skip to action** or technical acknowledgment

### From External Reviewers

Before implementing:

1. Check: Technically correct for THIS codebase?
2. Check: Breaks existing functionality?
3. Check: Reason for current implementation?
4. Check: Works on all platforms/versions?
5. Check: Does reviewer understand full context?

If suggestion seems wrong:

- Push back with technical reasoning

If can't easily verify:

- Say so: "I can't verify this without [X]. Should I [investigate/ask/proceed]?"

If conflicts with your human partner's prior decisions:

- Stop and discuss with your human partner first

**Principle:** External feedback = suggestions to evaluate, not orders to follow.

## YAGNI Check for "Professional" Features

If reviewer suggests "implementing properly":

- Search codebase for actual usage

If unused: "This endpoint isn't called. Remove it (YAGNI)?"
If used: Then implement properly

**Principle:** If we don't need this feature, don't add it.

## Implementation Order

For multi-item feedback:

1. Clarify anything unclear FIRST
2. Then implement in this order:
   - Blocking issues (breaks, security)
   - Simple fixes (typos, imports)
   - Complex fixes (refactoring, logic)
3. Ask user to test each fix individually
4. Ask user to verify no regressions

## When To Push Back

Push back when:

- Suggestion breaks existing functionality
- Reviewer lacks full context
- Violates YAGNI (unused feature)
- Technically incorrect for this stack
- Legacy/compatibility reasons exist
- Conflicts with your human partner's architectural decisions

**How to push back:**

- Use technical reasoning, not defensiveness
- Ask specific questions
- Reference working tests/code
- Involve your human partner if architectural

**Signal if uncomfortable pushing back out loud:** "Strange things are afoot at the Circle K"

## Acknowledging Correct Feedback

When feedback IS correct:

- ✅ "Fixed. [Brief description of what changed]"
- ✅ "Good catch - [specific issue]. Fixed in [location]."
- ✅ [Just fix it and show in the code]

**Why no thanks:** Actions speak. Just fix it. The code itself shows you heard the feedback.

**If you catch yourself about to write "Thanks":** DELETE IT. State the fix instead.

## Gracefully Correcting Your Pushback

If you pushed back and were wrong:

- ✅ "You were right - I checked [X] and it does [Y]. Implementing now."
- ✅ "Verified this and you're correct. My initial understanding was wrong because [reason]. Fixing."

- ❌ Long apology
- ❌ Defending why you pushed back
- ❌ Over-explaining

State the correction factually and move on.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake                      | Fix                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Performative agreement       | State requirement or just act        |
| Blind implementation         | Verify against codebase first        |
| Batch without testing        | One at a time, ask user to test each |
| Assuming reviewer is right   | Check if breaks things               |
| Avoiding pushback            | Technical correctness > comfort      |
| Partial implementation       | Clarify all items first              |
| Can't verify, proceed anyway | State limitation, ask for direction  |

## Rationalizations to Avoid

- "The reviewer is always right" → WRONG. Verify first.
- "I should agree to be polite" → WRONG. Technical correctness over social comfort.
- "I'll implement it all at once" → WRONG. One at a time, test each.
- "I understand most of it, I'll ask about the rest later" → WRONG. Clarify all unclear items first.
- "I can't verify this, but I'll proceed anyway" → WRONG. State limitation, ask for direction.

## The Bottom Line

**External feedback = suggestions to evaluate, not orders to follow.**

Verify. Question. Then implement.

No performative agreement. Technical rigor always.
