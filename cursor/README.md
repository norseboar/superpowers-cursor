# Cursor Adaptation

This directory contains adaptations of Claude skills and capabilities into Cursor-usable formats.

## Overview

Since Cursor doesn't have a "skills" system like Claude, these adaptations will primarily take the form of:

- **Cursor Commands** - Most of the skills will be converted into Cursor commands that can be invoked directly
- **Cursor Rules** - Some skills may be better suited as Cursor rules that guide behavior automatically

## Structure

This directory will be organized to mirror the skills structure, with each skill adapted into the appropriate Cursor format (command or rule).

## Purpose

The goal is to make the powerful capabilities developed for Claude available within Cursor's workflow, adapting them to Cursor's command-based and rule-based systems.
